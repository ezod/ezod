At [Opreto](https://github.com/opreto), I architect and guide the development of world-class software solutions across a variety of application domains. I use agile practices effectively to deliver quality outcomes on time. I am particularly interested in the application of agile principles to research and development, and in bridging the gap from academic/prototype code to robust and maintainable production-quality software.

I have 20+ years of professional R&D experience in robotics, autonomous vehicles, industrial controls, computer vision, embedded systems, and digital electronics. My key technical specialties include artificial perception, sensor planning and calibration, hybrid-modality sensor fusion, nonlinear optimization, localization and mapping, and object detection and tracking. I am an expert C, C++, and Python developer.

My hobbies include DJing and promoting disco parties, drumming, local history, metal detecting, masonry, retrocomputing, electronics, and lifelong learning about world history, physics, philosophy, and the mind.
