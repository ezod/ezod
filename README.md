At [Opreto](https://github.com/opreto), I architect and guide the development of world-class software solutions across a variety of application domains. I use agile practices effectively to deliver quality outcomes on time. I am particularly interested in the application of agile principles to research and development, and in bridging the gap from academic/prototype code to robust and maintainable production-quality software.
